# @everyone

**@everyone** is a Discord analytics tool that parses raw JSON data from your Discord messages and generates custom and engaging metrics personalized to you. These metrics are then used to build a high-dimensional embedding for each user, which is projected into a 3D semantic space.

Additionally, youâ€™ll get personalized commentary that explains your unique metrics, giving you a deeper understanding of your Discord activity.
